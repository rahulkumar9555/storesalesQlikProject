# **Store Sales Analysis and Dashboard Project**

## **Project Overview**
This project analyses sales, profit, customer and returns data from a superstore dataset. The dataset includes information about orders, products, customers, and returns across multiple regions and product categories. The goal is to derive insights and build visualizations that can assist stakeholders in making data-driven business decisions. The project is divided into two main parts: **data analysis using SQL** and **dashboard creation using Qlik Sense**.

### **Dataset**
The data is extracted from an Excel file containing the following three sheets:
1. **Orders**: This section contains order details such as sales, profit, product categories, customer information, shipping methods, and order priorities.
2. **Returns**: Lists returned orders, including their status.
3. **Users**: Includes customer-related data (not deeply explored in this project).

### **Key Objectives**
- Perform in-depth data analysis using SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.
- Create interactive visualizations in Qlik Sense based on the analysis.
- Present key business performance metrics such as total sales, profitability, shipping costs, return rates, and customer behaviour trends.

## **SQL Analysis**
Using SQL, various business questions were answered, such as:
- **Total sales and profits by region.**
-
- **Top-selling products and categories.**

- **Sales trade by month and their impact on profitability.**
- 
- 
- **Shipping method analysis and its impact on overall profit.**

### **SQL Queries**
Twenty SQL queries were created to answer specific business questions, ranging from calculating total sales and profits to understanding return patterns and shipping efficiency. These queries form the foundation of the data analysis process and provide the basis for creating the visualizations in the dashboard.

## **Qlik Sense Dashboard**
An interactive dashboard was designed using Qlik Sense to provide a visual representation of the insights derived from the dataset. The dashboard allows users to explore key performance indicators (KPIs) through charts and graphs, such as:
- **Sales by region and product category.**

- **Customer segment performance.**

- **Shipping times and costs across different regions.**

- **Customer segments contributing the most to sales and profits.**
- **Product return rates by category and region.**

### **Visualizations Included**
- **Bar charts** for comparing sales, profits, and return rates.
- **Pie charts** for showing proportions of sales by product categories and customer segments.
- **KPI widgets** for displaying critical metrics like total sales, profit, and return rates.
- **Geographical maps** to analyze regional performance.
- **Line charts** for trends such as shipping times and sales over time.

## **Conclusion**
This project delivers valuable insights into business performance using SQL-based analysis and interactive Qlik Sense dashboards. It enables users to understand key factors like product sales, regional profitability, and customer behavior, helping them make data-driven decisions to improve business performance.
